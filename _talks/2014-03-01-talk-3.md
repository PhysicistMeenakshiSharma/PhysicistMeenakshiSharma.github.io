The DAE-BRNS High Energy Physics (HEP) Symposium is a premier event held every other year in India, supported by the Board of Research in Nuclear Sciences (BRNS), Department of Atomic Energy (DAE), India. The symposium will consist of parallel & invited plenary sessions. A poster session will also be held to provide an opportunity to young researchers to showcase their research. The deliberations, from both experimental & theoretical perspectives, are expected to cover a variety of topics in particle physics, astroparticle physics, cosmology, heavy-ion physics and related areas.
