Several experimental observables, sensitive to the evolution of the system after nuclear collisions, reveal important information about the properties of the QGP. Among such observables is the production rate of strange quarks, which were originally predicted to be produced with higher probability in a QGP scenario with respect to a pure hadron gas scenario. Studies of strangeness production at LHC energies, compared with the lower energy measurements, can help to determine the properties of the hot system created in ultra-relativistic collisions of heavy ions. In this work, we present results on strangeness production in p-Pb collisions measured with the ALICE detector at the LHC.
The excellent tracking and particle identification capabilities of ALICE can be used to reconstruct strange hadrons via invariant-mass analysis of their weak decay products. The analysis status of strange (K0s and Λ ) hadrons in p-Pb collisions at 8.16 TeV at mid-rapidity as a function of pT and centrality will be presented and the recent results on strange particle productions in different systems and energies will be summarized and discussed.
