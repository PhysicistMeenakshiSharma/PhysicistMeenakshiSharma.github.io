The United Nations General Assembly adopted a resolution in December 2015 and declared February 11th as the International Day of Women and Girls in Science. This date should be recognised as a global celebration on equal participation and the accomplishments of female scientists.

International Masterclasses are launching Masterclass activities on the International Day of Women and Girls in Science. Institutes are encouraged to arrange a special Masterclass event for girls only. With this event we plan to support and promote the access of women and girls to science education and research activities.
